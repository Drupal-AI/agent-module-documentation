Paragraph Bundle Hero adds the `hero_bundle` Paragraph type(s) to the Paragraphs Bundles suite — a page-building bundle with a Content tab for its fields and a Display tab for per-instance colors, spacing, border, and background styling.

---

This submodule of [Paragraphs Bundles](../../../../1.0.x/agent/start.md) ships the `hero_bundle` paragraph type(s) as `config/optional` (paragraph type, field storages/instances, and default form/view displays), provisioned when the module is enabled. Like every bundle in the suite it reuses the base module's shared Display-tab fields (`pb_display_*`) and CSS-variable rendering: the template reads the color/opacity/spacing fields and emits CSS custom properties (`--pb-bg`, `--pb-tx`, `--pb-br`, …) plus utility classes on a `.paragraph__inner` wrapper, so appearance is data-driven per instance with no custom CSS and no jQuery. Add it to content by allowing the bundle in a Paragraphs reference field (on a node, or the suite's PB Content / PB Block). Depends on: `paragraphs_bundles`, `paragraph_bundle_image`.
